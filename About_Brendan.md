# **ALL ABOUT BRENDAN**
My name is Brendan and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Colorado, Boulder

Some of my hobbies are:
1. Running
2. Photography
3. Drums

I have been running for many years and have gotten somewhat fast getting a 800 time of 2:00.11, Mile of 4:32, and 5K at 16:39.  
Photography I have picked up in the last year or so.  
I started playing the drumkit 5-6 years ago and started playing instruments about 9 years ago.

I have made some projects on my free time including games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, and a Type practicer.
I have also made programs to help with my photography. One sorts all my images to neatly organize all of them
and another helps import them to my computer efficiently. This second program I use offen to speed up my sorting process.
Normally it takes about 10-15 minutes to sort through all the photos that are needed but this program reduces that time to
just 10-60 seconds. Lastly one of my big projects I am working on is recreating the entire game of Sorry in Python. It has been
a daunt of a task but I am slowly working my way through it.

This was a little bit about me and some of the things I have done and like to do.
