My name is Ethan, and I am Majoring in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder

Things I like to do:

playing pickleball with my family
playing soccer with my friends 
playing board games

I completed some coding in high school, as well as a summer course with alumni from Ivy League schools, where we learned about machine learning and applied it to predict crop yields.
